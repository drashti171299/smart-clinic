The main objective of this project is to implement a Healthcare Information System.

There are Three basic users - Patient, Admin, Doctors. All users have their own profiles in website

Patients can search for doctor and make online appointments. They also can view their health record, doctor’s prescription and medical expenses.

Doctor’s can see his upcoming  appointments, give e-prescription.

Admin has the authority to modify/delete doctor, view reports, total billing amount, currently how many appointments are booked.
